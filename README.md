- [GraphCMS account](https://graphcms.com/) (FREE)

## Setup

Clone this repository and then cd into the set directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hawyar/hawyar.com.git
cd hawyar.com
```

## Installation

A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
// npm install
```

Start the development environment

```bash
gatsby develop
```

Open http://localhost:8000 to see the site in development

Open http://localhost:8000/___graphql for GraphiQL

## Replace GraphCMS KEY

1. Rename `.env.Example` to `.env` and make sure it is ignored in your `.gitignore` file.

2. Log in to your GraphCMS account and get your API Access Key.
   > Go to **Settings** > **API Access** > **Endpoints**
3. Copy the url and paste it in the .env file

The `.env` should look like this

```js
GRAPH_CMS_KEY = PLACE_KEY_HERE
```

## Set API permissions

1. Go to **Settings** > **API Access** > **Public API permissions**
2. Check the **Content from stage Published** box.

**Note**: GraphCMS allows us to fetch DRAFT and PUBSLISHED posts. For production only check the PUBSLISHED box.
