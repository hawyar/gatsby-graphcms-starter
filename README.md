## Replace GraphCMS KEY

1. Rename `.env.Example` to `.env` and make sure it is ignored in your `.gitignore` file.

2. Log in to your GraphCMS account and get your API Access Key. (**Settings** > **API Access** > **Endpoints**)
3. Copy the url and paste it in the .env file

The `.env` file should look like this

```js
GRAPH_CMS_KEY = PLACE_KEY_HERE
```

## Set API permissions

1. Go to **Settings** > **API Access** > **Public API permissions**
2. Check the **Content from stage Published** box.

**Note**: GraphCMS allows us to fetch DRAFT and PUBSLISHED posts. For production only check the PUBSLISHED box.
